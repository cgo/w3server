1. How to build me
------------------
1.1 What you need
 - Linux or Solaris
   (Tested with Linux 2.2.13 and libc6)
 - pthread library
 - gcc or similar compiler (tested with egcs 2.91-66)
 - GNU make
 - libfl (from the flex package)
 - flex if you wish to remake the C-code for the lexical analyzers
   from the .lex files

1.2 What to do
 cd client
 make
 cd ../server
  edit the file src/w3server.c to change the HTML base directory and
  any other files or paths you want to have changed.
 make

1.3 If there are any problems ...
 ... check the output gcc generates and eventually modify the Makefiles.
In case of fire send email to 
christian@goschs.de or
beamb002@students.unisa.edu.au or 
tonly002@students.unisa.edu.au

2. Added functionality to standard version
------------------------------------------

2.1
It is now possible to send emails via SMTP. Only the rudimentary
protocol is supported, no MIME messages may be sent so far.
For further information see file include/w3smtp.h

2.2
Images should be downloaded automagically when an html file is
downloaded.
We used flex to generate the needed lexical analyzer. In order to
display the html file correctly with the Tcl displayer, it must be
piped through the correct program which hopefully replaces all IMG
tags with the corresponding local filenames for the images.
'correct' is built together with the client program when you type 'make' in the client directory.
