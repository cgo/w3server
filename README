IMPORTANT NOTICE:
-----------------
This is a simple HTTP server and a client program written in C. 
Note that the server may not support the whole of HTTP 1.0, but it works ok for
simple use. Please contact us if you want to make additions! We would love to 
add anything useful to the project.
We are not working actively on it at the moment.
There was a TCL/TK interface that used the client program contained in the
server source code. The client program is still there and can be used,
but I removed the TCL/TK interface code since I have no current contact details
of its author, Liuben Tonev.

Documentation can be found in doc/html/index.html.
The explanations how to build and use the programs can be found there.
This software was originally written in the scope of a computer networks lecture at
university.
The report is in docs/report.html (this is also referenced in the
code documentation mentioned above).

Prior to building, you should change some paths in
 source/server/src/w3server.c
which are hard-wired in the source (if you feel that should be different,
please make contributions!)

To make a build of the whole package try
 make clean; make
or
 make clean; make ALL
in this directory.

If something does not work, try
 make configure

To make new configure scripts for all packages, type
 make autoconf
You need GNU autoconf for this.

If a package does not compile correctly, it might be a good idea to do
a "make clean" in that package.

You can also change to the server or client directory and configure and make from there
directly using the configure scripts.
I recommend using only the server, there is no real need for a client
beside educational purposes.

The executables can be found in the respective source directories.
and are called client or server respectively.
